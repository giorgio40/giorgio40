### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Im currently finishing up the Lambda School program. Its been a long journey but the best thing I have done in my life for a change in careers. Im a full stack software engineer originally from Arlington, Virginia and have lived in Charlottesville, Virginia for the last 25 years. I have a passion to code I could do it 24 hours a day if I didnt enjoy my sleepy time!
